# Research_inspired_Self-Explaining-Neural-Networks-for-Business-Process-Monitoring

This project is insipred by https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18067v1. We attempt to re-create and deploy this model as a RESTful API. 

KEY QUOTE 1 from research paper = "explaining
why an algorithm predicts a lengthy wait for a hospital procedure or foresees a bank customer declining
a loan offer is vital for offering valuable insights to
stakeholders and clients." 

INSPIRED BY - NAP LSTMbased model

follows a methodology akin to the general self-explaining framework (Alvarez Melis and
Jaakkola, 2018) and its more recent adaptation to the
sufficient explanation setting (Bassan et al., 2025).
